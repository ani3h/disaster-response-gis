# 🌍 Disaster Response GIS

### Real-Time Impact Mapping and Safe Route Visualization for Emergency Management

This project aims to create an **interactive GIS-based disaster response dashboard** that visualizes real-time disaster impact zones, identifies safe evacuation routes, and maps nearby shelters and hospitals. By integrating spatial data, open-source mapping tools, and real-time datasets, the system enhances **situational awareness** and **disaster response coordination**.

---

## Features
- Real-time visualization of disaster impact zones (floods, cyclones, earthquakes)
- Safe route and evacuation path optimization using network analysis
- Mapping of hospitals, shelters, and safe zones
- Integration of open-source datasets (OSM, NDMA, Bhuvan, IMD)
- Interactive web dashboard using **Leaflet/Folium** and **Flask/Django**

## Project Objectives
- Develop a real-time GIS dashboard for visualizing disaster impacts  
- Identify optimal evacuation routes using spatial and network analysis  
- Demonstrate the potential of open GIS data for emergency planning
